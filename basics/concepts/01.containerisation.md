### Container

A collection of software processes unified by one namespace, with access to an operating system kernel that it shared with other containers and little to no access between containers.

### Containers
- Include the application and all of it's dependencies
- Share the kernel with other containers
- Not tied to infrastructure only needs Docker engine installed on the host
- Runs as isolated processes in user space on the host OS

### Benefits of containers
Applications are:
	- portable
	- packaged in a standard way

Deployment is:
	- easy
	- repeatable
	
### Docker instance

A runtime instance of a Docker image contains 3 things:
	- a docker image
	- an execution environment
	- a standard set of instructions

### Docker image

- Compromised of the runtime and packaging tool.
- must be installed on the hosts that run docker

### Docker store a.k.a Docker Hub

- An online cloud service where users can store and share their Docker images.

### Virtual machine

- One or many applications
- The necessary binaries and libraries
- The entire guest operating system to interact with the applications
