# Node Selection

## Taints and Tolerations

What kind of pods can be setup in what kind of nodes.

(taint - a trace of a bad or undesirable substance or quality)

we set taints on nodes to set restrictions on what pods could be set up on the nodes.
we then add toleration to pods, so that it can tolerate the taint

`kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect`
ex:
`kubectl taint nodes node-name app=bute:NoSchedule`

taint-effect:

- NoSchedule
- PreferNoSchedule # will try to avoid placing on pods on the node
- NoExecute # new pod will not be scheduled, existing pod will be evicted if they do not tolerate the taint

the pod will get killed when it gets evicted

## Node Selector

 We can specify node via labels, refer: `nodeSelector` in pod definition.yaml
 `k label nodes node-name label-key=label-value`

 We cannot achieve complex logic like place pod in all node that is less than 2gb ram etc...
 or conditional labels `small and large`

 To get such complex logic done `node affiniy and anti-affinity were introduced`

 ## Node affinity and Anti Affinity
 The nodes have labels and the pods have config that makes them choose such node.


### Important to remember that

setting tolerant on pod does not mean that it will go to the tainted node.
it can very well go to other node, it just is tolerant towards the taint

Another concept called `node affinity` tackles that

`master node` scheduler does not schedule any pod because of the taint

`k describe node kubemaster | grep Taint`

Likewise, setting affinity rules on pod, does not gurantee the node that only such pods can get placed in the node. Any other pod might also get placed in the node.

A combination of both can make it more precise or deterimental
