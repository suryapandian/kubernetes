# Containerisation

Unlike virtual machines, containers and the host share the same kernel. Host and the containers are seperated by their namespaces.

Docker has many users, by default processes in docker are run under it's root user. To run under a different user

`docker run --user=1000 ubuntu sleep 3600`

or in dockerfile

```
FROM ubuntu
USER 1000 #the process will run under userid 1000
```

The root user within the container isn't the host root user

The root user of the host has lots of privileges like `CHOWN` `SETGID` `SETUID` `NET_BIND` `MAC_ADMIN` etc...

To add any of these privileges to the docker user
`docker run --cap-add MAC_ADMIN ubuntu`

drop privileges using
`docker run --cap-drop KILL ubuntu`

run with all privileges
`docker run --privileged ubuntu`

Instead of configuring at a container level via docker, we can configure on a pod level. However, the settings on the container will override the settings on the container.
