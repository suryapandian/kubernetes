### Metrics server

the default metrics server of k8s, gets metrics data like cpu usage, ram usage etc... of various pods aggregates them and stores them in memory of the metrics server.

Since the metrics are stored in memory we cannot see historical metrics data.

In each node, `kubelet` is running which talks to API master server.
The `kubelet` contains `ci-advisor` and sends metrics to `metrics-server`
