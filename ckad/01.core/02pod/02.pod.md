### POD

Prequisites:
 - An application has been developed
 - Docker image pushed to dockerhub so that k8s can pull it down
 - k8s cluster has already been setup and is working, this could be a single node setup or a multi-node setup. All the services need to be in a running state.

 k8s does not deploy containers directly in worker nodes. k8s encapsulates containers in a k8s object called pods. A pod is a single instance of an application. A pod is the smallest object you can create in k8s

 pod - container - 1:1 relationship

 A single pod can have multiple container when they are not of the same kind. Like application container + helper container, both can use same storage space.
 If our intention was to scale our application, we would have to create additional pod.
 Multipod container is a rare use case

### how do deploy pods?

what does `k8s run` command do?
ex: `k8s run ngnix --image ngnix`
It creates a pod and deploys an instance of the ngnix docker image.
Where does it get the application image from? We need to specify image name in the `image` parameter.
The application image name, in this case `ngnix` image is downloaded from docker hub repository.
Docker hub is the public repository where various docker images are stored.
You can configure k8s to pull the image from public docker hub or private company's docker hub.

k8s uses yaml files as inputs for the creation of objects like pods, deployments, replicas, services etc...
