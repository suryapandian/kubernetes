### Nw policy

k8s by default allows access from one pod to another within the cluster unless a nw policy is applied on the pod.

### Ingress

Unlike all services like ClusterIP, NodePort and LoadBalancer, Ingress is actually NOT a type of service. Instead, it sits in front of multiple services and act as a “smart router” or entrypoint into your cluster.

### Controllers
In robotics and automation, a control loop is a non-terminating loop that regulates the state of a system.

Here is one example of a control loop: a thermostat in a room.

When you set the temperature, that's telling the thermostat about your desired state. The actual room temperature is the current state. The thermostat acts to bring the current state closer to the desired state, by turning equipment on or off.
In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state. 

`kubectl create ingress <ingress-name> --rule="host/path=service:port"`

`kubectl create ingress ingress-test --rule="wear.my-online-store.com/wear*=wear-service:80"`

### Ingress Controllers

In order for the Ingress resource to work, the cluster must have an ingress controller running. An ingress controller is a deployment. The image of this deployment could be nginx.

GCP (HTTP load balancer) and Nginx are supported and maintained by the k8s project.
