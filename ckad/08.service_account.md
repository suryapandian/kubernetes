# Service account
Service account  is related to authentication, authorization, RBAC- Role Based Access Control etc...

## Two types of service accounts:
- user account: admin, developer etc...
- service account: application to interact with k8s cluster. ex: prometheus could use k8s api to poll and know about cluster health. Jenkins use k8s API to deploy in cluster

## Create service account
`k create serviceaccount dashboard-sa`
when a service account is created, it also creates a token automatically

this token must be used by external application to access k8s api.

This token is the name of the k8s secret, where the actual token is present.

`Authorization Bearer` token is this token

If the service accessing the token is in the same cluster, we can simply mount the token in the pod and can be easily read by application

Each namespace has a default service account, every pod in the namespace is mounted with that token

So, in every pod if you do `ls`, you will see `ca.crt`, `namespace` and `token`. Where `token` is the default serviceAccount token.

Default serviceAccount has limited permissions to k8s API.

## Roles and Role bindings

`k get roles.rbac.authorization.k8s.io`

`k get rolebindings.rbac.authorization.k8s.io`
