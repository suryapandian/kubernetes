# PVC - Persistant Volume Claim

Instead of mounting volumes on nodes. 
A sys admin will allocate large chunk of volume and then the devs can use part of it.
An admin creates persistant volume and the user creates persistant volume claims

Every PVC is bound to a PV

During the binding process, k8s tries to find a PV with sufficient capacity with properties like sufficient capacity, access modes, volume modes, storage class etc...

If there are multiple matches, we can use labels and selectors to bind to the volume.
A smaller claim might get bound to a larger volumes and no other PVC will be able to use the PV.

If no other volume is available then the PVC will remain in a pending state until newer volumes are made available to the cluster.

### Static provisioning

Before even creating persistent volume, we need to make sure that the volume exists in the cloud. This is called static provisioning

### Dynamic provisioning

WIth storage classes we can configure "storage classes" using which cloud service providers like GCP automatically creates
