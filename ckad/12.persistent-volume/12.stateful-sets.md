### Stateful sets 

Stateful sets are similar to deployment sets in the sense that they can perform deployments, create pods etc...

But the difference here is that pods are created in a **sequential** manner. Only after pod1 is created, pod2 can get created. Pod name has an indexed name. 

definition is similar to deployment, we can just update kind to `StatefulSet`

we should associate stateful set with `serviceName` 

When `podManagementPolicy` is set as `parallel` then the pods are scaled up and down in a parallel fashion. The default behaviour is orderly.

`subDomain` and `hostName` is automatically assigned to the pods created for a stateful sets. `subdomain` name depends on the headless servicename and hostname depends on podname.


With respect to deployments, all the spec definition of pods created of the deployment have similar configuration as given in the deployment.

However with stateful sets, especially with `volumeClaimTemplate` , each pods gets created it's own PVC.

```yaml
volumeClaimTemplate:
	- metadata:
		name: data-volume
	spec:
	 accessModes:
	 	- ReadWriteOnly
	 storageClassName: google-storage
	 resources:
	 	requests:
	 	  storage: 500Mi
```		 	

When the pod is deleted and recreated instead of deleting and recreating the PVC. The PVC is maintained and the new pods gets attached to the PVC.
