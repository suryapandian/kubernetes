### Deployment

When we create a new deployment, a rollout is created. A new rollout creates a new deployment-revision.

`k create -f deployment-definition.yml`

`k rollout status deployment/deployment-name`


`k rollout history deployment/deployment-name`

When a new deployment is created, first we create a new replica set which then creates the pods for the new deployment.

To undo deployment

`k rollout undo deployment/deployment-name`


### Types of deployment strategy

- Rolling update - default:
	We destroy older version one by one and create new version. This way application is not down

- Recreate strategy:
	Destroy all of the old version and create new version of new application

### Commands

`k apply -f deployment-def.yml` - would apply the definition

`k set image deployment/deployment-name nginx=nginx:1.9.1` would update the image of the deployment but the deployment file would remain the same.
