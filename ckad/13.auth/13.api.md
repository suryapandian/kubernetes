# API group

to get the api version

`curl https://kube-master:6443/version --key admin.key --cert admin.cert --cacert ca.crt`

instead of always having to pass the certificates we can run 

`k proxy` which will start a http server with config loaded from kubeconfig hence we need not always pass `key`, `cert` and `cacert` 

*** important to note that kube proxy is not the same as kubectl proxy ***

kube proxy: used to enable connectivity between pods and services 
kubectl proxy: http server used to access kube master

`curl https://kube-master:6443/api/v1/pods`

we have lots of such APIs like `/metrics`, `/logs` (to integrate with 3rd party logging)

### apis are categorised into two

- core: namespaces, pods, rc, events, endpoints, nodes, bindings, pv, pvc etc... 
- named: apps, extensions, networking, storage, authentication, authorization etc... (named apis are more categorised and under each category there are other APIs)


we can get list of apis by:

`curl https://kube-master:6443 -k`

`curl https://kube-master:6443 -k` | grep name // this gets the named api
