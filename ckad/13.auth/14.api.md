### API

v1 - GA stable (Generally available stable version)

alpha - may have bugs, only for expert users interested in giving early feedback, may get dropped

beta - after bug fix beta gets released

Even though there are multiple versions, we can use only one "preferred version"

Not sure how to set preferred version but preferred version is the version that you get when you query k8s. `k get pods` the version that you get here is the preferred version.

Regardless of the version that you use to create an object the version with which the version is stored in etc is called the storage version.

Preferred or storage version is usually the same.

As of now we cannot check storage version, but preferred version can be seen in apis.

storage version can be seen by directly querying the etcd storage.

`kubectl convert -f nginx.yaml --output-version apps/v1`

(we need to install convert separately by going through the document)
