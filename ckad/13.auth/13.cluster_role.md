### Cluster Role

Namespaces are not applicable for nodes. As in, we cannot say that this node should be in this namespace. Namespaces are applicable only for pods.

Like nodes there are other resources that are not namespaced as well.

`kubectl api-resources --namespaced=true`

`kubectl api-resources --namespaced=false`


roles and rolebinds are used to auth within namespaces.

Clusteroles are for authorizing across cluster. There are many users that have access cluster wide like cluster admin, storage admin etc...
